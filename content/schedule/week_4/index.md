## Description

This week, we'll explore the dynamics of homeownership in the United States, focusing on the evolution of access to capital for homeownership and how disparities in access to capital have important consequences for certain populations. We'll think about the evolution of the U.S. banking system and the ways in which financial innovation have changed who bears the risk in lending capital for homeownership. We'll also think about how those changes shift risk away from banks and towards capital investors and housing consumers.

We will be joined this week by Kim Gollings who is the Community Development Director at Habitat for Humanity of Champaign County. Habitat simultaneously takes on the role of being a housing developer, bank, and social service agency, offering a unique and valuable perspective on multiple aspects of homeownership. Kim has worked closely with our class in the past on projects related to increasing the value and impact of Habitat's work to the neighborhood scale.
