## Description

This week we will examine a range of housing production strategies, many that involve public-private partnerships or incentives to deliver affordable housing. We will be joined by Professor Michelle Layser from the University of Illinois College of Law who is an expert in tax law. She will help us to understand how provisions of the tax code are leveraged to stimulate investment in affordable housing. We'll also talk about the Opportunity Zone program which leverages tax benefits to investors for investments in eligible underinvested neighborhoods.
